Introduction:
E-commerce platform vendors may provide major promotions (e.g., discounts or cash 
coupons) on specified days or during specific vacations in order to attract a high number of 
new consumers.
Discount marketing and couponing are common promotional strategies for recruiting new 
consumers as well as keeping and strengthening existing customer loyalty. The ability to 
measure a consumer's propensity to use coupons and estimate redemption behaviour are 
crucial factors in determining the success of a marketing campaign.
Promotions for the client are sent out via a range of channels, including email, notifications, 
and social media. In a number of these promotions, coupons are issued for a single product 
or a range of items.
